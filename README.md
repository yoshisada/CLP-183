# Vue Start

<h1>Project for CSE 183 </h1>
By Ryan Millet, Ryan Suematsu, and Steven Au

<h3> Curriculum Leave Plan Web Project </h3> 

This project is to replicate part of the Curriculum Leave Plan excel sheet and integrate it into a web framework of py4web and vue.js. The project is also hosted on Google's Cloud System.

<h5>What is the CLP?</h5>
stands for Campus Curriculum and Leave Planning 

The CLP is used by the admin and teaching staff at UCSC to assist with planning and distributing course assignments to instructors.

- Campus curricular planning
- Course scheduling
- Faculty leave planning for academic departments, divisions, colleges, and interdisciplinary programs
- Providing executive level information for use in forecasting trends and managing campus   level resources

<h5>Problem</h5>

To create a better system to manage CLP than excel.
Permissions: Certain users are able to edit specific information and be able to see different tables.
Interactibility: Integrate Vue into a table planner that is intuitive, responsive and helpful

<h5>Basic Structure and Usage</h5>

The CLP is organized by discrete planners that contain all of the course and instructor information (e.g. course names, staff assignments by quarter, key dates, etc.) for a specified period of timeâ€”typically one school year.
Once a planner is selected, the main user interface is divided into two tab views, one displaying information by class and the other by instructor.
